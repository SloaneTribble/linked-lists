# linked-lists
This assignment from The Odin Project focuses on implementing a 
singly-linked list along with several functions for its use and analysis.  

The linked list is implemented with JavaScript -- a node "points" to 
the next node in the list by assigning it as one of its properties.  

When nodes are removed from the list, they are not destroyed; the list just stops
referring to them.
